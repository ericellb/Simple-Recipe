## Simple Reacipe

This was my first project using React (Class based components) to feature full stack development. This is used along with the API @ https://github.com/ericellb/Simple-Recipe-Api and the data was aquired using the Scraper @ https://github.com/ericellb/Simple-Recipe-Scraper

## Project  Description

You can view recipes sorted by Foodtype or Cuisine type, and also search through the database for specific recipe.

Users have the ability to Rate and Submit new recipes if they log in.

Admins are able to add / remove admins and approve / deny recipes through the Admin Dashboard.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
